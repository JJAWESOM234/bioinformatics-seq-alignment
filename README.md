# TODO
- Update scoring Matrix to reflect http://rosalind.info/glossary/dnafull/ DNAFULL symmetric scoring.
- Add affine gap penalties (favor longer gaps as opposed to many small gaps)
- Limit sequence table to print only if the sequence lengths are less than or equal to 20
- Add U (Uracil) as a valid character
